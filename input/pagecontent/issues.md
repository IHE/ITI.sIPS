## Significant Changes

### Version 1.0.0-comment

- First Public-Comment
- Previously named Accessibility to IPS (aIPS). Name was changed due to potential misunderstanding of other meanings of accessibility around user experience with disability.

### Relationship of sIPS to PCC-IPS

The [PCC-IPS](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/PCC/IHE_PCC_Suppl_IPS.pdf) is being broken up into distinct Profiles starting with the sIPS Implementation Guide (Profile). Other parts of [PCC-IPS](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/PCC/IHE_PCC_Suppl_IPS.pdf) are expected to be published in the coming months and years as resources become available. The sIPS takes precedence over equivalent profiling found in the [PCC-IPS](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/PCC/IHE_PCC_Suppl_IPS.pdf) however those parts of the [PCC-IPS](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/PCC/IHE_PCC_Suppl_IPS.pdf) that have not been published in other forms are still relevant.

## Issues

### Submit an Issue

IHE welcomes [New Issues](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.sIPS/issues/new/choose) from the GitHub community.
For those without GitHub access, issues may be submitted to the [ITI Public Comment form](https://www.ihe.net/ITI_Public_Comments/).

As issues are submitted they will be managed on the [sIPS GitHub Issues](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.sIPS/issues), where discussion and workarounds may be found. These issues, when critical, will be processed using the normal [IHE Change Proposal](https://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Category:CPs) management and balloting.
It is important to note that as soon as a Change Proposal is approved, it carries the same weight as a published Implementation Guide (i.e., it is testable at an [IHE Connectathon](https://www.ihe.net/participate/connectathon/) from the time it is approved, even if it will not be integrated until several months later).

### Open Issues

- [sIPS_001: Minimal View Option](https://github.com/IHE/ITI.sIPS/issues/8) is referring the reader to FHIR Core for Documents. Are there more specific requirements available from IPS or IHE?

### Closed Issues

none
