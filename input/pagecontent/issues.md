### Relationship of aIPS to PCC-IPS

The [PCC-IPS](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/PCC/IHE_PCC_Suppl_IPS.pdf) is being broken up into distinct Profiles starting with the aIPS Implementation Guide (Profile). Other parts of [PCC-IPS](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/PCC/IHE_PCC_Suppl_IPS.pdf) are expected to be published in the coming months and years as resources become available. The aIPS takes precedence over equivalent profiling found in the [PCC-IPS](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/PCC/IHE_PCC_Suppl_IPS.pdf) however those parts of the [PCC-IPS](https://www.ihe.net/uploadedFiles/Documents/PCC/IHE_PCC_Suppl_IPS.pdf) that have not been published in other forms are still relevant.
